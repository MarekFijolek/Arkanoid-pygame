# Arkanoid
***
Arkanoid is a simple game where you, the player, have to bounce the ball from your pad and destroy all the tiles above.

This simplified version of this classic game consists of several levels, after beating every stage the current progress is saved to file.

All graphics have been done by me using Adobe Photoshop, source files for them can be found in folder titled 'PHOTOSHOP...', whereas the renders are located in 'Res' as well as the save state file.

The game was written in Python 2.7 with pygame library.

I also included a python script which can be used to make .exe file with the game in case one wanted to run it e.g. from a pendrive.
